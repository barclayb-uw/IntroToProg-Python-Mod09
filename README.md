## Modules for the win

Last week was a struggle, there is no doubt about that, it was a tough week.  Heading in to this week I was a little apprehensive, but once I got rolling into the material I found that things came together nicely and I was able to get a good working set of code.   It certainly helped that the modules were all part of the labs we were working on, that gave me confidence in creating working parts, now I just needed to assemble them.

Working with multiple files this week was a little different, previously we were really focussed on writing code to a single Python file and working with input or output files, but this week my pycharm looked much different with many files accross the top.

Now that I had all the modules created and the different classes in the correct files I needed to figure out how to use them in my main.py file.   The first thing that needed to happen was to import the classes that I was going to use.  Initially I just imported the entire module file, but then I realized I needed to call out the classes I wanted from each file and did just that.  

Now that I have my classes imported I needed to build out the main body of the code, what were we supposed to actually do.  The first thing was to load my employee file which was easy enough.  Then I needed to get my menu working and all the assundry options that went with it.  Since we have worked with menus before I was well prepared for this step.   I created a section for each possible menu choice and then called the appropriate class to run it.  This was all wrapped in a While(True) statement and I added a little error checking for good measure.  

This week got me back on track and after verifying my code worked as expected I dug into the new GIT command line interface to move the code to GitHub.  That was a bit tricky, but I was able to make it work.  I added a new branch called master, which wasnâ€™t completely intentional, but my files made it up there and I figured out how to make master m default so they were easy to find.  It was good to get back on track and I am looking forward to the final week of class this coming week.
